# elm project

This simple script creates a very basic [elm](http://elm-lang.org/) project.

## Prerequisites:

* Node.js must be installed

## Usage:

run `elm-project.sh <projectname>` and it will be done :-)
elm does not have to be installed prior to running this script it will detect if it is already installed
and do so for you if not.
It will also install 'http-server' for test purposes.

Have fun,

Ivo.
